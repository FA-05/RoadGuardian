## What is RoadGuardian:
RoadGuardian is my final year project at high school [ITT Buonarroti](https://www.buonarroti.tn.it/).\
This platform allows police officers to issue fines or report accidents.\
Each report is identified by a barcode, enabling people to easily access the report details.

<br><br>

## How to navigate through the website:\
You can log in as an admin to view all the data:\
Username: admin\
Password: admin

You can also log in as a police officer to issue fines or report accidents:\
**Username**: Vigile4\
**Password**: 123

Once a fine has been created, users can view its details by entering the barcode at the bottom of the homepage.

<br><br>

## Tech-Stack:
To build this web application, I used the following technologies:\
**Front-end**: HTML, JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI (for UI components).\
**Back-end**: PHP, MySQL.
